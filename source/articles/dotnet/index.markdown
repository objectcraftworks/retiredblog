## ASP.NET/MVC
    
##### [Handling Exceptions in ASP.NET/MVC in MVC way](aspnet/mvc/exceptions/explained)
If you need a custom model for your Error view, or your Error view needs a master/layout that depends on ViewData set by controllers, you will end up putting the domain logic in the error view. This complicates your unit testing efforts.  This is a 4 part how-to series. We will apply DRY to handle exceptions in MVC way. We will cover how:
 
* Default exception handling works in [Part 1](aspnet/mvc/exceptions/explained) 
* To keep the view data items set by the controllers for Error Views in [Part 2](aspnet/mvc/exceptions/keep-viewdata) 
* To use a custom model for an error view in [Part 3](aspnet/mvc/exceptions/custom-model).
* To set custom ViewData for ErrorViews in [Part 4](aspnet/mvc/exceptions/custom-viewdata).
